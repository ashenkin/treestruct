\arguments{
\item{cyl_file}{path to file with the cylinder data}

\item{calc_sapwood}{Whether or not sapwood should be calculated, Default: T}

\item{sapwood_depth}{Set assumed sapwood depth (cm) at the base of the tree, Default: 2}

\item{treeid}{identifier to use in outputs for this tree, Default: basename(cyl_file)}

\item{size_classes}{branch diameter size classes (cm) across which aggregated computations will be made, Default: c(0,1,3,5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120,130,140)}

\value{
a list of metrics and an updated tree structure dataframe with metrics appended to each row
}
\description{
Reads in a cyl file (which is usually created by treeqsm), and calculates path length, surface area, volume, and sapwood metrics.
