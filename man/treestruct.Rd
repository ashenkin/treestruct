\title{treestruct: A package for processing and analysing tree structural data}
\description{
The treestruct package handles tree data derived from QSM models as well as
from hand-measured data.  The key differences between the two are the
organizations of the corresponding data frames.  QSM tree data includes the following
columns:
Hand-measured data (usually from branches), in contrast, contains the following
columns:\preformatted{"branch_code", "date", "internode_id", "parent_id", "n_furcation", "len",
"major_child_angle", "angle_internode_1", "angle_internode_2", "number_nodes_in_section",
"is_tip", "is_broken", "d_child", "d_parent"
}
